Hi! Welcome to my homework reposytory ^^
I'm working hard on making this looks *better* than it is. It takes some time, but don't need to worry, please wait patiently. To make your waiting time feel like a glimpse, try watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvyku3Q81oc&list=PLzIbTmX5fP4zyXMwWXiBWc4jlu9e9MrrJ&index=1).

This reposytory was mostly inspired by Captain Jack Sparrow words:
> The problem is not the proble. The problem is your attitude about the problem. *Do you understand?*

I deffinetly do, so, the problem of not yet being able to stack all my files in different folders does not bother me that much. **Just you wait, just you wait...**

There is also some things I can assure you with. Here is the table with things I do know how to exploit.
